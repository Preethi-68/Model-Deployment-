# Model-Deployment-

This project demonstrates how to create a deployment environment for a machine learning model from start to finish. I have developed and trained the model, ensuring high performance through rigorous evaluation. I have serialized the model using Python's pickle library to enable efficient storage and reuse.

To make the model accessible, I have implemented an API using Flask, creating endpoints that handle JSON inputs and outputs for seamless integration. I have containerized the Flask application using Docker, both for development and production, by writing and optimizing Dockerfiles to build efficient Docker images.

Furthermore, I have orchestrated the deployment using Kubernetes, configuring deployments and services to ensure scalability, load balancing, and rolling updates. I have integrated monitoring and logging solutions to track the application's performance and quickly address any issues.

By implementing these steps, I have created a scalable and maintainable machine learning service that is ready for real-time production use.
